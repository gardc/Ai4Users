# AI4Users
The motivation for our project is to help customers design, prototype, and evaluate
tools that give non-experts a better understanding of AI applications. We want to
turn the design knowledge we gain into practical design principles that will make
it easier to create and use responsible AI in public services. Many of these public
services are today found online, for example, services related to taxes, unemploy-
ment, and student loans. We aim to improve AI intelligibility and accountability for an AI
model suggesting the expected total duration of sick leave.

## Description

In this project we developed a web application that addresses the case of ensuring AI accountability and intelligibility in an online public service using an AI model to estimate the total duration of sick leave.

## Prerequisites

Before installing AI4Users, ensure that you have the following software, tools, or libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- Node.js (optional, for frontend development)
- Noe

_For detailed installation instructions, please refer to the respective documentation._

## Installation

First, in the project directory run, run:

```bash
1. npm install

```
Then, run the development server
```bash
2. npm run dev

```

This runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. 

***Remember to add the mongoDB connection URI to your .env.local file like this:***
```bash
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"
```

## Configuration

_Describe any required configuration details here, such as environment variables or configuration files._

## Usage

_Include examples of how to use the project, such as command line examples or code snippets._
