This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, in the project directory run, run:

```bash
1. npm install

```
Then, run the development server
```bash
2. npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

***Remember to add the mongoDB connection URI to your .env.local file like this:***
```bash
MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017"
```


## Collaborate with your team

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.



## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
